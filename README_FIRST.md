- Make sure Docker is running
- Click Remote window button

- Click "Reopen in Container"
  - ![alt text](/.devcontainer/menuImage.png)
- The container should start building
- Docker was being stupid/I couldnt figure out how to install the requirements in the Dockerfile so run this to get python stuff
  - ```./.devcontainer/getPythonReqs.sh```
  - Should only have to do this the very first time you start dev container
- Follow the build directions in ITA-CBS-401Group/README
- If any python scripts dont work
  - In ITA-CBS2-401Group do ```source /workspaces/ITA-CBS_dev-main/python/myenv/bin/activate```
